                Armenian heritage, particularly Western Armenian,</strong> through
                diverse social, artistic and cultural projects and events.
            </p>

            <p class="hnarti-mission">Hnarti was founded as a means to <strong>reconnect with our roots and
                explore the profound depth and significance of our cultural
                heritage.</strong> Together, we can prevent our culture from fading away
                and ensure that our legacy thrives for generations to come.
            </p>

            <p class="hnarti-call-to-action">Join us in this vital mission to preserve and

        <p class="meaning-question">We frequently get asked, 'What does "Hnarti" mean?'</p>

        <p class="meaning-core-vision">Therefore, the name 'Hnarti' embodies the platform's core vision of bridging<br>our past to our present, on a journey to rediscover our heritage and history.</p>

        <p class="meaning-deeper">However, a closer look reveals a hidden word within the name that reflects a deeper meaning.</p>

                    words and dragging her unsuspecting family into
